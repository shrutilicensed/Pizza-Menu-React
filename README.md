### Pizza menu !

Hosted at ðŸ‘‰ [Fast React Pizza Co.]("https://fastreactpizzaco.netlify.app/")

Pizza Menu is my first small project on React which made use of the following concepts :

- Components
- Adding inline css
- Adding external CSS
- Using props
- Rendering Lists
- Reusing Components
- Conditional Rendering of classes, text and elements
- Destructuring Props
- Strict Mode
- React Fragment

Here's a preview of how it looks like:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
